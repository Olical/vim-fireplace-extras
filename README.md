# vim-scotch

A set of mappings taken from my [dotfiles][], as mentioned in my post [Editing Clojure with Neovim][post]. These are bindings that have improved my usage of [vim-fireplace][] a fair bit, I thought I'd make them easier for others to use by putting them in a tiny plugin.

## Mappings

...

## Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, mine is [vim-plug][].

```viml
Plug 'Olical/vim-fireplace-extras'
```
